2013-02-26, version 2.4.0

  them with a field "editable".

  which can be used to prevent redrawing the timeline after every addItem.

  default.

  rendered after add trigger (which can cancel the create action).

  (issues #19 and #54).
- fixed: options scale and step did not work (method setScale worked correctly
  though).

  when the option box.align was "left" or "right" instead of the default
  "center".
- fixed: DataTable columns may now have their name defined as label or id,
  and the first three columns can have any order now. More robust and flexible.
- fixed: when deleting an item via deleteItem, the currently selection is
  maintained instead of unselected (issue #47).

  to another group.

  but move the timeline slightly (less than 1px).
